# 3T fetal thermometry
Estimate of Fetal Brain Temperature Using PRF Thermometry during Fetal MRI

This repository contains the code and data used for analysis in the paper.

Fetal_temp_analysis_submission.ipynb is a jupyter notebook for the analysis on relative fetal temperature.
Please copy and paste the link to the notebook (https://github.com/jacob-ellison/fetal/blob/main/Fetal_temp_analysis_submission.ipynb) into the .ipynb location box on the website (https://nbviewer.org/). This will allow all the plots to be rendered correctly for better viewing.

GA_differences.ipynb is a jupyter notebook for analysis on differences in Gestational Age between groups.

ROIs and phase metrics are stored in records_temp/ (Fetal_temps_v2.csv containes corrected image numbers and durations).
MATLAB processing code starts with /fetal/temp/get_temp_comdiv.m.

Any data not available in this repositiory (raw images and k-space data) is availbale upon request.
